# Python library for equilibrium of legged robots

This library uses common operations over [convex
polyhedra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_polyhedron) in higher dimensions in order to assess the problem of stability and motion feasibility of legged robots.

## Installation
APT dependencies:
- CVXOPT
- GLPK
- Cython

Python dependencies:
- numpy
- scipy
- pycddlib
- matplotlib

Install dependencies by:
```
sudo apt-get install cython libglpk-dev python python-dev python-pip python-scipy
CVXOPT_BUILD_GLPK=1 pip install cvxopt --user
pip install pycddlib --user
```
You can remove all ``--user`` arguments to install these Python modules system-wide.

## Optional dependencies:

- [Ipopt](https://projects.coin-or.org/Ipopt) and its Python interface [Pypi](https://pypi.org/project/ipopt/) for the solution of large-scale nonlinear optimization problems
- [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) for the generation of Matplotlib animations
- [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html) for testing of dependencies installation and for development

For installing the optional dependencies run the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
```
Finally, clone this repository and run its setup script:
```
git clone git@github.com:orsoromeo/legsthrust.git
cd legsthrust
python setup.py build
python setup.py install --user
```
## Testing the library
Jet-Leg comes with a number of unit tests intended to check the proper installation of the packages and make sure that all the mandatory depedencies are properly found. For this purpose, after completing the installation navigate to the [unit_test_main.py](https://gitlab.advr.iit.it/rorsolino/jet-leg/blob/master/unit_tests/unit_test_main.py) and run it.

## Troubleshooting

- if CVXOPT is not found even after trying the pip-installation, we then suggest to try install the version 1.1.4 of CVXOPT using Synaptic
